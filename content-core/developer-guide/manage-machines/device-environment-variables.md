Some environment variables are available on the device after its successful onboarding.
These are also available to the deployments on the device. These are:

*  **RIO_DEVICE_NAME_LAST_SEEN**: Stores the name of the device that was present at the time of onboarding. Please note that changes made to the deviceâ€™s name through rapyuta.io UI or APIs will not reflect back on this environment variable.
*  **RIO_DEVICE_ID**: Stores the unique identifier of the device.
*  **RIO_PROJECT_ID**: Stores the unique identifier of the project in which the device was created.
