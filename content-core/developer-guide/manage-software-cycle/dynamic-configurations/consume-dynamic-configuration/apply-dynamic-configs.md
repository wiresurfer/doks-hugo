Labels of a device help in associating it with a set of configuration
parameters. The configuration parameters are resolved by matching device labels
with attributes defined in configuration hierarchies. There are two ways of applying parameters to devices.

1. If you want to apply a set of parameters to multiple devices at once.    
   Hover over the attribute node whose configuration parameter file node 
   you want to apply to a group of devices. 
   Then, click on **Apply** option (a check or tick mark).
    {{% notice note %}}
 Before applying the configuration parameter, 
 ensure that your device is properly labeled 
 with all the required key-value pairs and 
 the key-value pair matches with the name 
 of attribute and value nodes.
   {{% /notice %}}
2. If you want to aggregate all parameters across all configuration
   hierarchies and then apply them to a single device.    
   Select the device from **DEVICES** panel on the left navigation bar.
   Click on **Apply Configuration
   Parameters**.
