An organization is an enterprise customer or a small business team or
an individual developer like you who signs up for rapyuta.io and subscribes
to its tools and services for building efficient robotics applications.

Each organization has an _admin_, that is, the very first user that
registers and signs into rapyuta.io. The *admin* is responsible for on-boarding the organization on to rapyuta.io and providing necessary
details (e.g. organization name, website) to complete the registration
process. rapyuta.io grants the highest privilege to the admin than
any user can have, and is responsible for managing users (invite/remove)
and billing.

The organization panel displays information relevant to an organization
and a list of *Activated* users.
