rapyuta.io provides searchable logs (*historical logs*) for
components, executables, and associated cloud bridges of deployment both in the cloud or on a device.

Additionally, for components deployed on the cloud, rapyuta.io offers a
to stream (*live logs*) and follow stdout/stderr.

Add a ROS package to rapyuta.io, which will have a component with
cloud runtime. It will publish the ROS topic _/telemetry_ with **Maximum** **QoS** as well as print debug information to ***stdout***. Deploy the package on the cloud, and name the deployment as
***ROS publisher exclusive deployment***

1. On the left navigation bar, click **DEPLOYMENTS**.
2. Select specific deployment whose logs you want to view or analyze.
   In this example, select ***ROS publisher exclusive deployment***.
3. On the deployment's **DETAILS** tab, ensure the green progress bar is at **Succeeded** and **Status:Running** point.

## Stdout Logs

To view or analyse the corresponding deployment logs, click **Historical Logs**.
![Deployment detials page](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/deployment-hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

The historical deployment logs is displayed, where you can view the log’s timestamp,
its component name and executable name, and its information or message.
![Historical logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/hist-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

You can use the toggle button to filter the logs based on the timestamp, component, or the executables available in the deployment.

You can select a specific *component-executable* combination to view its corresponding logs.
You may also select multiple such combinations. If you select only a component’s name, you will
view all the logs generated by all of the executables of that component. If no component is selected,
you will view all the logs generated by all of the components that are deployed. For example,
the historical logs of only the **Talker** component are shown below.

You can choose to view logs from within a time range.
But, ensure the time slice is neither in the past from the start time of a deployment nor in the future from now. You will be able to view
logs up to ***seven days*** in the past if a deployment has been running till now.

You can also download historical logs of a deployment as a ***.log*** file by clicking the download button.
![Download logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/download-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

The **Download Historical logs** page appears. Clicking on the button with download icon, the **Paginated Download Logs** modal should appear. If the logs are less than 100,000 lines, they are directly downloaded, and the modal is not shown.

You may want to refresh the logs by clicking the refresh button.
![Refresh logs](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/historical-logs/refresh-button.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)

Any errors or exceptions that occur while logs are being generated are redirected to ***stderr*** output window, but otherwise,
a valid logs output is displayed in ***stdout*** window.

## Indexed Logs
To view the corresponding deployment logs in real-time, click **Live Logs** tab. They are streamed in a terminal-like window and can be useful to view and debug your application in the cloud as it generates new logs. The rapyuta.io platform allows you to view the live 
It is similar to the ***tail -f*** functionality one is used to in a UNIX terminal console.
![Live Logs tab](/images/core-concepts/logging/deployment-logs/realtime-logs/deployment-live-logs.png?classes=border,shadow&width=50pc)


The **Live Logs** tab allows you to do the following.

* View the realtime logs of the deployed components and the associated cloud bridges.

* Download the live log details  to your local machine by clicking the download icon.

* Search for a specific phrase in the continuous log stream by entering the phrase inside the **Search** box. If there is a match, all occurrences of matching patterns of the phrase are highlighted.

* View logs in the full-screen mode by clicking on the **fullscreen** icon that is located at the top right corner of the terminal-like window.
