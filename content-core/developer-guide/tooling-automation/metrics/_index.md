After onboarding a device, rapyuta.io lets you collect statistical
data generated by the device. You can analyze and monitor this data in real-time as an interactive graph.

The data includes [system metrics](/developer-guide/tooling-automation/metrics/system_metrics/) that are associated with the device's memory, CPU, disk, and network interface. The level of
[QoS guarantee](/developer-guide/tooling-automation/metrics/system_metrics/qos-guarantee/) determines the effort of the delivery of messages from the device to rapyuta.io.

rapyuta.io supports collecting metrics from published ROS topics on the device. You can leverage this to measure custom-defined metrics data like velocity, temperature, etc.
Read [metrics from ROS topics](/developer-guide/tooling-automation/metrics/ros-support/) to know what are the supported data types for custom ROS messages.

The several metrics are available under the **Metrics** tab. Before you can visualize any metric data, you have to subscribe to a particular system metric or a ROS topic. Read the
[metrics visualization guide](/developer-guide/tooling-automation/metrics/visualise-metrics/) to learn how to create an interactive visualization of metrics data.
