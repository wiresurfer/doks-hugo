## Welcome
Welcome to the rapyuta.io documentation, where you can find information
and guides to help you learn about rapyuta.io and start exploring its
features.

## What is rapyuta.io
rapyuta.io is a platform that enables robotics solution development by providing the necessary software infrastructure and facilitating the interaction between multiple stakeholders who contribute to the
solution development.

## In Detail
The software infrastructure can be seen as a collection of the
following four layers and the facilitation is enabled by hardware
and software catalogs.

* **Machine Layer**    
    Monitor the machine and manage the onboard software - remotely via API or Web UI.
* **Communications Layer**    
    Secure and scalable machine-to-machine and machine-to-cloud communication with ROS compatibility.
* **Computation Layer**    
    Build, ship, monitor, and control distributed applications running on any machine anywhere.
* **Intelligence Layer**    
    Distributed intelligence that gives your heterogeneous multi-robot system the robustness and flexibility.
* **Composition Tooling**    
    Compose, simulate, and deploy your applications with the community all in one place.
* **Software Catalog**    
    Leverage software features from all across the globe. Batteries included for Enterprise Clients: laser-based localization, navigation, and depalletization.
* **Hardware Catalog**    
    Choose the hardware that best suits your needs or offer your hardware to the world.

## What does it solve
Given the multi-domain and embryonic stage of the robotics
industry, robotics solution developers face the following three
challenges: lack of expertise, limited budget, and time.
The pain points of the solution provider and gains using the
project's J-curve.

## Vision
Our mission is to empower lives with connected machines. Machine - from
robots, automation equipment, servers to network devices - connected and
coordinated in a streamlined way to increase efficiency and reduce
the human effort in 3K - kitanai (dirty), kiken (dangerous),
kitsui (demanding) - work.

To make these machines more accessible, we follow the cloud robotics
model defined as

> Cloud Robotics is a model enabling self-service, elastic, and ubiquitous
access to a shared pool of robotics resources with open interfaces.

This model is inspired by the cloud computing model[1] is a broader
definition of Cloud Robotics compared to the Cloud-connected Robotics
definition by Kuffner[2].

## Our Origins
Our journey on Cloud Robotics started with [RoboEarth](http://roboearth.ethz.ch/),
an EU-funded project from 2010 to 2014, whose goal is to create an
***internet for robots***, where robots could enjoy both a *shared*
(via a common knowledge base) and an *extended* (via servers in a data center)
brain.

The founding members of what would become Rapyuta Robotics made up the
ETH Zurich team of the RoboEarth project. Our partners included six
universities and the Dutch electronics giant Philips. For more details
on our prior work, have a look at the following papers and videos:
